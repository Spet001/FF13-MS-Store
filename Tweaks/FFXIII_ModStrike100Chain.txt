:\This mod changes the base chain increment for the -strike abilities.  By adjusting the base
:\increment downward, this causes the AI to not choose these abilities unless other factors exist
:\(such as a weakness to an element).  In this manner, the alternating magic/strike animation will
:\no longer occur with a high frequency.  There are two versions of this mod.  The first Chain 99%
:\only reduces the base chain increment from 10.0% to 9.9%.  This will prevent alternating strikes
:\under normal circumstances or for enemies with multiple weaknesses.  The other version reduces
:\the base chain increment to 9.2% eliminating the -strike attacks for even enemies that have only
:\one weakness.  The downside to this mod is that the chain gauge will increase less per full ATB
:\bar, however this will not affect any additional chain bonuses as the AI will still alternate
:\attacks, just not with the -strike abilities.
