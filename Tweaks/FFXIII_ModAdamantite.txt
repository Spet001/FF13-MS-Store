:\This mod changes the rare drop rate for an Adamantortoise from a Trapezohedran to
:\Adamantite.  The rare drop rate is also increased from 1% to 3% to compensate for
:\the lower value drop.  This mod was created as there is no place within the game
:\to acquire adamantite other than purchasing it from a shop.
